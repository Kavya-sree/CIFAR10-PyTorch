# CIFAR10-PyTorch
CIFAR10 CNN implementation using PyTorch

Trained a Convolutional Neural Network model(CNN) to perform Multi-Class Image Classification. The model defines four convolutional layers to extract features from input images and max-pooling layers to reduce the spatial size of the resulting feature map. The output from the convolutional layers is then passed through fully connected layers for classification, with dropout applied for regularization. It's been trained on CIFAR-10 dataset for 20 epochs on a GPU. It achieved a testing accuracy of 68.08% on a testing dataset of 10,000 images.
